File system monitoring for instant updates on config changes\n2. Periodic polling \\(5s\\) to ensure no changes are missed\n3. Smart debouncing \\(100ms\\) to avoid excessive updates\n\nAgent status is inferred from task ownership:\n- WORKING: Agent has tasks with status \"in_progress\"\n- IDLE: Agent has no active tasks\n- COMPLETED: Agent''s tasks are completed\nEOF\n\\)\")",
